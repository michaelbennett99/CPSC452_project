# Remote Runs

The `remote_runs` directory is used to store the results of remote model runs.

All the runs in this directory were carried out on a single RTX 4070 GPU with 24GB of VRAM for 2 hours each using the Vast.ai GPU rental service on the docker instance described in the [Docker](../Docker) section.
